# 🚨 Theft Detection System

A basic project for theft detection using OpenCV and an IoT camera.

## 📜 Description

This project is designed to detect motion using an IoT camera and OpenCV. It captures video, processes the frames to detect motion, and can trigger an alert if motion is detected.

## 📦 Features

- Captures video from an IoT camera
- Detects motion based on frame differences
- Draws rectangles around detected motion
- Prints an alert message when motion is detected

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Requests

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aditya-kr86/Theft-Detection-System.git
   cd Theft-Detection-System
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy requests
   ```

### Usage

1. Replace `CAMERA_URL` in `main.py` with your IoT camera URL.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** - for scripting
- **OpenCV** - for video processing
- **NumPy** - for numerical operations
- **Requests** - for sending notifications

## 💡 Ideas for Improvement

- Add support for different types of cameras.
- Implement a more sophisticated alert mechanism (e.g., sending emails or SMS).
- Improve motion detection accuracy.
